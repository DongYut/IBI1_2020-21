My question:
At 2020-03-31, how difference is the propotion of death in China to that in US? Why?

Question is addressed from line 49.

The results shows that the death propotion of China is about 4% while in US it is 1%. 
We can infer that the overall medical level in two countries may cause the differences.
In China, the government had more strict rules for epidemic control but the social medical level is low comparing to US.
Also, different races may have differences. The virus' lethality may be higher to yellow race.
So the number of patients in China is less than US, while the death propotion is higher.
