The distance from human and mouse protein is 1091. The percentage of identical amino acids is 89.68609865470853%.
The distance from human and random protein is -250. The percentage of identical amino acids is 5.829596412556048%.
The distance from mouse and random protein is -250. The percentage of identical amino acids is 6.278026905829592%.

Interpretation:
  The human protein has only 10% difference from mouse protein. Which states that two species have a relative close relationship.
The distance from human, mouse protein to random protein is same, -250. I thinks it is essential but I can't give professional ideas about it.
  Every evidence shows that human has a close relationship in biology with mouse. However there's still 1091 distance in SOD2 proteins.
The two species are close, but when coming to experiment, we can't predict human reaction all from mouses since many differences exist.
